								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poland started the Family 500+ program to provide families benefits in an effort to fight high 
								levels of childhood poverty. Families receive 500PLN per month for each child 
								after the first until the child’s 18th birthday.  The program was announced in early-mid 2015 and 
								went into effect April 2016.  At the same time, Poland has been experiencing a declining birth rate 
								for many years and the Family 500+ program hoped to encourage fertility.  I decided to focus on 
								what effects this program has had on the country’s birth rate.

							<p class="overview-text" align="left" style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left:10px">
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hybrid narrative structure I used for this visualization is <b>Interactive Slideshow</b>.  
								I am using this structure to tell a short story regarding two areas of investigation. It is organized 
								with an introduction, an "About" slide the viewer can navigate down to. Navigating right brings the viewer to 
								the first slide where they navigate 
								through chart scenes to see the story I am presenting as well as and further explore data independently.  
								The viewer then navigates right to the next slide where they view the second chart's scenes for the story 
								and individual data exploration.  Arrows in the lower right hand corner navigate this Interactive Slideshow.

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories in the slides are told in a consistent manner throuh the use of annotations on each scene in 
								addition to the detailed info on the side. The viewer can choose to step through the scenes in any order 
								based on the scene numbers in the buttons at the top of the graph.  Following the natural progression 
								through the numbered scenes, viewers are guided through the information I chose to highlight.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first slide  consists of multiple scenes covering the total births over the past 
								decade as well as births by birth order.  The viewer can choose to step through the scenes in any order 
								based on the scene numbers in the buttons at the top of the graph, and following those scenes in order
								tells the story of the overall decreasing birth rate in the country until the start of 
								the Family 500 program, after which overall birth rate increases.  The viewer then learns that the 
								births of second and third children increase greatly, which are the children targeted by the program,
								indicating a measurable level of success.  The final scene in this slide allows the viewer to interact 
								with and explore the data on their own with zoom, toggling lines on or off, click-drag to pan data.
								
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viewer can then transition the presentation to the next slide where they are presented with an
								investigation on the age of mothers when they gave birth.  It is a stacked bar chart with each years'
								data being a stack of births broken down by marital status and location, grouped by mother's
								age.  This identifies the demographics most affected by the introduction of the program.
								This follows the same scene presentation as the first slide by
								providing scene navigation buttons at the top of the chart.  It also follows the consistent 
								annotation structure to tell the story across scenes following the natural progression of the numbered
								slides. The viewer is told the story on decreasing or slowing birth rate, especially in younger mothers,
								until the start of the program when birth rate goes up across all age groups, espcially older mothers.  
								The viewer can explore the full data at the final scene.

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annotations are used in the scenes to highlight meaningful elements of 
								the data in the charts.  They 
								follow a consistent structure across slides as well as scenes within the slides.  Changing the scene 
								through the use of the numbered scene buttons will provide a new, different view of the data with different 
								annotations providing information for that scene.  In addition to the static annotations on each scene,
								viewers may hover over data elements to get tooltips with exact data for the point in time or
								category they wish to investigate.

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main parameter in each slide is the scene number provided in the buttons.  These scene number 
								change the years for which data is provided, so year is partially a parameter.  Clicking the scene parameter buttons will update the view to provide the chart with 
								essentially the "page" of the story so that the story can be
								told.  Stepping through the pages will highlight information with 
								annotations as the text of each page's story.
								In the first slide's final chart scene,  parameters are the birth order categories of Total births,
								1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th+ child.  Toggling these parameters will filter their respective data
								on or off by the viewer and provide the viewer control of the data for investigation.

							<p align="left" style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px"><b>Triggers</b></p>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is an interactive slideshow, triggers are used with the reveal.js arrows in the lower right 
								hand corner for transitioning the slides.  These arrows highlight on hover to indicate they are 
								interactive and appear only on valid transitions to drive the presentation.	The numbered scene buttons 
								in each slide drive the changes the for the charts.  They highlight on hover 
								to indicate they are interactive. Current scene button is grayed out to indicate position.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first chart on total births and birth order has triggers for data filtering.  Clicking items in the
								legend will enable/disable birth order category lines in the chart which not only toggle the lines to 
								filter the data,
								but they also rescale the axes for only the currently enabled data. These instructions are labeled
								beneath the legend to inform the viewer of the control. The viewer can zoom in on data with mouse scroll
								to see more detail.  The user can also click-drag the chart to pan across the data.  Hovering over lines
								will trigger a tooltip with more information about the year in the mouse hover range.  Additionally, 
								this hover trigger draws circles over the data points for which more data is being displayed in the tooltip.
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second chart has less interactivity than the first, but still provides methods for further investigation
								of the data by the viewer.  Hovering over bar segments in the stacked bar chart triggers a tooltip 
								which provides more information for the year hovered in the current age group chart.  It provides the same
								slide and scene transition triggers as well.

										<b>Births in Poland by Birth Order</b>
										<br><br>
										</b>
										This graph focuses on the number of births per year while also paying investigating the birth order of the child.  
										This is important to look at because the Family 500+ program’s financial benefits are given for each child after the first. 
										<br><br>
										<b>Click through the scene buttons at the upper left hand of the chart</b> to step through the story.  You will learn how 
										Poland’s birth rate had been decreasing for the majority of the previous decade.  The government identified that 
										poverty levels were a large contributing factor to this downward trend, so they studied the potential impact of 
										providing financial incentives to families with multiple children.  You will learn that in the first couple of 
										years after the announcement and implementation of the program the birth rate reversed course and increased rather 
										significantly.  While not many mothers started new families (flat rate for first children) man existing families 
										added second and third children.
										<br><br>
										Once the final scene is reached you are free to explore the data closer.  A tooltip will provide instruction 
										on navigating the data, plus they will remain as a footnote below the chart.

								<b>Births in Poland by Mother's Age</b>
								<br><br>
								</b>
								This chart explores who is having children with respect to the mothers’ age.  A demographic breakout is used 
								for mother’s marital status and location of birth (rural vs urban).  The cumulative total of each demographics’ births account 
								for the total of births for each age group for the year.  Each discrete demographic is represented by a different color in 
								order to highlight the different demographics.
								<br><br>
								<b>Click through the scene buttons at the upper left hand of the chart</b> to step through the story. You will see that there is an ongoing 
								trend where younger mothers are having significantly fewer children year-over-year.  
								Older mothers are having more children year-over-year, but the absolute number of children being born to these age groups does not make 
								up for the losses in the younger age groups.  In all age groups, the number of children born to unmarried women stays fairly flat.
								<br><br>
								Continuing through the story you will learn that once the Family 500+ program is announced and implemented, the decrease in births to younger 
								age groups slows down and goes flat.  Older mothers continue having more children during this time as well.  The most significant increases 
								in births are in the middle age groups.  These are the women that were expected to see the most benefit from the government stipends and 
								the data appears to mirror that.
